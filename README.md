# Engine-Blower-
Mechanical Design Project | DWG Files Included

This project demonstrates the design and layout of an Engine Blower Assembly using AutoCAD. All components were modeled individually and are prepared for assembly in a master DWG file. The project replicates a real-world mechanical design workflow.

This work is based on the YouTube learning series by ACS Mechanical:
"Mechanical Project in AutoCAD | Last Part | Engine Blower Assembly"

What I Learned: 
1. 2D drafting and modeling of engine components in AutoCAD
2. Layer management, object snapping, and part referencing
3. Manual layout and alignment of parts for pseudo-assembly
4. File management for multi-part engineering projects

Included Parts (DWG files): 
1. Engine Blower
2. Engine Mounting
3. Piston
4. Piston Pin
5. Crankshaft
6. Connecting Rod
7. Bolts
8. Impeller

Project Files
All DWG files for individual parts are ready and can be inserted into an assembly layout using block insertion or Xrefs in AutoCAD.

Next Steps
1. Create a new file named engine_blower_assembly.dwg
2. Insert each part file using Insert â†’ Block or Attach Xref
3. Use MOVE, ROTATE, and ALIGN commands for positioning
4. Annotate and dimension the layout as needed
5. Optionally export to 2D technical drawing (PDF or DWG)

Requirements: 
AutoCAD 2025

Basic proficiency with:
1. Drawing and editing commands
2. Inserting external references
3. Managing layers and layouts
